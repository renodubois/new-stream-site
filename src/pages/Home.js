					I live in St. Louis MO, and am a full stack dev by day. I am interested in web development of all
					kinds, but I especially enjoy working with open source software.
					<br />
					<br />
					Currently, Iâ€™m helping to create a set of data analytics tools for St. Louis City election results
					(and eventually other cities), you can view the project{" "}
					<a href="https://github.com/miec-stl">here</a>.
					<br />
					<br />
					I also have 2 cats (Sunny and Korok) and a husky (Juno) that make occasional appearances on streams!
					<br />
					<br />
					Come say hello on one of our <a href="https://twitch.tv/RenoInMO">Twitch Streams</a> or talk to me
